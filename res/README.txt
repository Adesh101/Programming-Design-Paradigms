DESCRIPTION

Portfolio creation through the console: The user can create a portfolio by entering the portfolio name in the console and later add stocks to it
Portfolio creation through CSV file: The user can choose to create a portfolio by providing an existing CSV file that has portfolio and stock data in it.
Adding stocks to the portfolio: If the portfolio already has stocks in it, then it cannot be modified. The add stock operation can be performed on only empty portfolios. To add stocks, the user has to provide a valid portfolio name to which stocks are to be added.

The stocks will be successfully added to the portfolio only if valid inputs are provided
