Portfolio creation through the console: The user can create a portfolio by entering the portfolio name in the console and later add stocks to it
Portfolio creation through CSV file: The user can choose to create a portfolio by providing an existing CSV file that has portfolio and stock data in it.

To add stocks, the user has to provide a valid portfolio name to which stocks are to be added.
